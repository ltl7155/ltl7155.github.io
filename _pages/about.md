I'm a final-year Ph.D student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).

My Ph.D. research primarily focuses on the broad intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.
