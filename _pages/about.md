I'm a final-year Ph.D student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). 
I have been awarded third place in the AISG Trusted Media Challenge, receiving a cash prize of 25,000 SGD, along with the AISG PhD Fellowship and the DAAD AInet Fellowship.

My Ph.D. research primarily focuses on the broad intersection between Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering.
